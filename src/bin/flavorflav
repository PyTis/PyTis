This program/script helps display the curent "flavor" of linux you are running;
without having to remember what to run, which changes depending on the OS.

I wrote it to work on ALL Unix based operating systems, even "Cygwin." 
If you find one that it does NOT work on, please add/alter code so that it does
wokr on your OS, and create a pull request.
