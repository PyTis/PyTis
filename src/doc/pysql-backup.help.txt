    -c [INT <None, 0 - 999>], --clean=[INT <None, 0 - 999>]
                        How many days worth of backups (if any) should be
                        purged/removed from the target directory, before we
                        get to the meat and tators.  Default None (off by

  SQL Connection Arguments:
    --database=[DATABASE-NAME]
                        We do not recommend you use this flag, if you only
                        want to backup one database, you might as well just
                        use mysqldump or pg_dump.  However, if you are just
                        testing this tool,then that is the only time I can
                        think of, to specify a single database.  This option
                        does not get saved to the ini file.
    -d [DRIVER], --driver=[DRIVER]
                        MySQL by default, you can also choose PostgreSQL (case
                        in-sensative).
    -e [Exlude,Excludes], --exclude-database=[Exlude,Excludes]
                        An accumulator that will continuesly add new databases
                        to exclude, as many times it is called.  Additionally,
                        it can be presented with commas, so that it only need
                        be called one time.  This will split on commas.
    -f [FLAGS], --flags=[FLAGS]
                        Flags to pass to mysqldump/pg_dump.
    -H [HOST], --host=[HOST]
                        Sets the hostname if other than localhost.
    -P [INT], --port=[INT]
                        Use different port to connect to your MySQL db.
    -p [PASSWORD], --password=[PASSWORD]
                        Password for connecting to the MySQL db.If one is not
                        provided via STDIN, user will be prompted.
    -t [DIR PATH], --target=[DIR PATH]
                        Target directory to store file to.  The name is auto-
                        generated by this program. *(use "--help" for more
                        information)
    -u [USER], --user=[USER]
                        User to connect as. If no user is provided current
                        user will be used.
