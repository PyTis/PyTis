TODO/TASKS
==========

Need to create a passthru program so that apache can easily access the scripts
without a .py extension.

Need to clean up each programs helptext and remove old un-needed options.

I realized that one some of my programs use the generic, catch-all
pytis_tools.ini, and others use only their own .ini, I'd like there be an easy
option for it to be both, with inheritance, where a program could look for its
own ini file, as the primary, but if not found, load default values from the
pytis_tools.ini.

MILESTONES
==========

Need to get the list of working programs completed for GitHub.

Create setup.py installer for our tools.

Create a tool that uses our deep help (--help) and generates man pages, and
installs them ( w.i.p., 60% done)) 

Create Man Pages for each of our tools, alter setup.py to actually install
these as well.

Need to learn git branching, so I can have one branch for W.I.P. and one for
completed, functional scripts.
