I wrote many, many of these scripts, very, very long ago, as I learned Python and Linux.  

I look at them like a mechanic 

I make scripts all the time to help achieve mundane tasks.  I wish to share them, and to allow them to be expanded upon.  
Since I've started, I've come to use ONE file as a central class and function library.  
I do use some OO inheritance as well.. Many of my tools need updated.  To use this, or to use it now that it has been updated.  

* Feel free to download and share this library of tools. 
* Feel free to make fixes or even add-ons;

however I retain the right to control what gets added in, or not.
